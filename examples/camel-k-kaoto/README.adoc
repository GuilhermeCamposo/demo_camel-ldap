= Camel K Dependency

Example on how to use https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.12.x/traits/dependencies.html#_configuration[Camel K's dependency trait] to add custom dependencies.

== Deploying it

Once the automation is done you can start the following steps

=== Configuring Nexus 

* Use `admin/admin123` to log in Nexus
* Enable anonymous access
* Create a new repository (maven2) called `camel-k`
* You need to package `ldap-config`. To do so, run `mvn package` on `ldap-config` folder
* Upload the jar file to `camel-k` repository

== Deploy the route

In the `camel-k-dependecy/camel-k` run:

----
oc project camel-k-ldap
kamel run ldap-route.yaml
